    <b>You don't have to remember <em>everything</em></b>
<br>Many things were learned in this lesson.
<br> Thankfully you learn that search engines such as <a href="www.google.com">this one</a>, will allow you to do research for things such as <b>tags and elements</b> that you can use to write <b>HTML</b> documents.</br>

<p>You have to make sure you use the correct <em>tags and elements</em> when writing <b>HTML</b> documents since computers can be stupid and fogetting to close a <em>tag</em> can mean the <em>element</em> affecting how what we wrong looks</p>
<p> We also learned that when we search something online, the computer sends a <b>HTTP</b> request to the <b>servers</b> and then it finds and sends over the  <b>HTML</b> documents which ends up being the information that we get back in our screens.<p> 
<p>The <b>HTML</b> documents that include <em>tags and elements</em> to write the code are what produce what we see in our screens!<p>
